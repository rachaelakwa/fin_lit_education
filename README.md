Before my summer break, if I had played a game of jeopardy on the topic of financial markets and the ins and outs of trading and investing, I would have lost a lot of money. Learning complex financial concepts during a summer program inspired my partner and I to created a financial educational website as our final project. Incorporating a jeopardy game, we utilized Flask in Python and HTML and CSS to create pages on concepts such as asset management, liquidity and capital access. We believed that this education should be accessible to all who are interested and we incorporated a game to encourage users to test their knowledge and not feel overwhelemed by the jargon.
